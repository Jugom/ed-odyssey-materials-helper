**What file should you download?**
If you are on Windows, you can install the auto updater msi file
If you are on Linux, you can install the auto updater deb file

The auto updaters will check for a new version on launch.
The portable zip versions are used as update packages. You can run them standalone, but they are no longer truly portable as settings are stored on the local machine.

**Release notes for this version:**
Allow searching for spawn locations in ship materials tab
Update Type-8 boost interval
Allow module stats to run down further to be able to show the full range of stats
Correct boost interval for Python Mk2
