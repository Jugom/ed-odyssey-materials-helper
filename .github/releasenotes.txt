**What file should you download?**
If you are on Windows, you can install the auto updater msi file
If you are on Linux, you can install the auto updater deb or rpm file. If you are on an unsupported linux distro, you can download the portable autoupdater zip file.

The auto updaters will check for a new version on launch.
The portable zip versions are used as update packages. You can run them standalone, but they are no longer truly portable as settings are stored on the local machine.

**Release notes for this version:**
UI rework
- The UI has been completely reworked for better maintainability and performance
- You shouldn't see too much of the rework, everything mostly looks like it did before, except a bit more uniform
- The progress bar on the loading screen will now indicate the progress of loading the journal
- The loading screen will be shown when switching commander and the UI is fully rebuild afterwards.
- Switching commander should be faster and more responsive now
- The UI has been profiled for memory leaks and *should* not contain any leaks
- Almost every text is localizable now, so translators can get to work!
- The Ship Editor still needs some work, but it is on the list
- There may still be some styling and layout issues, feel free to report anything you notice or think is wrong.

Other notable changes:
Loadout tab now shows options for modules to set the module as equipped or unequipped(previously double click)
Material requirement cards now include fleetcarrier amounts
In the menu the cards show ranges for the required materials based on engineer ranks
Remove WIP from Corsair
Corrected armour mass values for Type-8 and Corsair. These were changed after the initial release of the ship.
Added price for Corsair
Added a 250ms delay when highlighting blueprints on the wishlist to make it a bit less flashing
Added missing rank reward Salvage profits 100% at rank 100 to Felicia Winters
Handle leaving a power in the UI

Future plans:
Finish Ship Editor UI rework
With the UI rework almost done, it will become easier to adapt existing components in the UI.
Like the module buttons in the loadout tab, I want to make the app more verbose. There are other hidden features
that many people likely don't know about.
Update the Colonisation tab to show the current progress of your projects automatically.
Rework the blueprints on the wishlist to support quantities
Rework the Ship Editor to support smaller screen sizes
