**What file should you download?**
If you are on Windows, you can install the auto updater msi file
If you are on Linux, you can install the auto updater deb file

The auto updaters will check for a new version on launch.
The portable zip versions are used as update packages. You can run them standalone, but they are no longer truly portable as settings are stored on the local machine.

**Release notes for this version:**
Added powerplay tab
- Track your powerplay progression towards unlocks
- See what other powers have to offer
- Required event is only written at startup, so requires a relog to update
- Not entirely confident about the source data for the unlocking ranks, so do report any errors you find
