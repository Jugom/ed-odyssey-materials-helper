**What file should you download?**
If you are on Windows, you can install the auto updater msi file
If you are on Linux, you can install the auto updater deb file

The auto updaters will check for a new version on launch.
The portable zip versions are used as update packages. You can run them standalone, but they are no longer truly portable as settings are stored on the local machine.

**Release notes for this version:**
Bugfix for autoupdater failing to launch the application with an ampersand(&) in the path
Fix clip size and burst size for Double Shot experimental effect on Fragment Cannon
Add more detailed values to Concord Cannon
