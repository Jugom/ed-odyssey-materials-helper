**What file should you download?**
If you are on Windows, you can install the auto updater msi file
If you are on Linux, you can install the auto updater deb file

The auto updaters will check for a new version on launch.
The portable zip versions are used as update packages. You can run them standalone, but they are no longer truly portable as settings are stored on the local machine.

**Release notes for this version:**
Add Mandalay ship (TODO: ship stats)
Add Mandalay Armour modules (TODO: module stats)
Fix sending FCMaterials Items list to EDDN. Was sending empty lists.
Ensure all progress bars initialize whether journal data is correct. (Weekly rewards are not logged and require a fresh journal to show up in the app correctly)
